## What is DECS?
HOCS (Home Office Correspondence System), known in business contexts as DECS, is a tracking and routing tool that “allows Home Office teams to control and audit the flow of all correspondence through its life-cycle from receipt to final response”.

DECS is mostly written in Java, using the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/) library. Frontend components are written using JavaScript, often [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Almost all DECS code is open-source and publicly available on GitHub.
