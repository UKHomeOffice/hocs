## What is DECS?
HOCS (Home Office Correspondence System), known in business contexts as DECS, is a tracking and routing tool that “allows Home Office teams to control and audit the flow of all correspondence through its life-cycle from receipt to final response”.

DECS is mostly written in Java, using the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/) library. Frontend components are written using JavaScript, with a [React](https://react.dev/) client-side application and a NodeJS [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server.

Almost all [DECS code](../code-repos) is open-source and publicly available on GitHub.
