## What is the timeline?
A case on DECS is presented with a timeline. The timeline highlights events in the lifecycle of a case.

## Events
Timeline events can be thought of as belonging within a category:
- System event
- Business event
- Process event
- Case note

### System events
System events are characterised as actions the system performs, initiated by a user action.

An example of a system event is creation of a case.

### Business events
Business events are things that happen within the service which are of interest to the business, as opposed to system events which are used trigger actions within the system.

An example of a business event is updating a data field "behind-the-scenes" based off the user selection of an option on a different field.

### Process events
Process events are initiated from actions taken within a business process model.

An example of a process event includes scenarios where a case may be rejected from a stage and sent back to a previous stage with a rejection note. The rejection note is inputted by the user as free form text and the rejection note is added to the timeline.

### Case notes
Case notes are created by users directly on the timeline by adding a Case Note and entering free form text.
